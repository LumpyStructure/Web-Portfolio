I created this website during an online webinar with guidance from the host, and using a template made by [Tristen Tomczak](https://github.com/ttomczak3/Milky-Way) using Astro. It was my first experience of using Github to manage my own project, as well as being my first experience of creating a website. As you would expect, there were many issues along the way, but with the help of the webinar host and the other participants I managed to deploy it, using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) to host the website.

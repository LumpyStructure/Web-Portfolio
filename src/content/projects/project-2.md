This was one of my dad's DIY projects that he did years ago, but over time it had become more and more unreliable. I decided to have a crack at it and over the course of a few months I replaced the microcontroller, upgrading from a knock-off Arduino to a genuine one with a built in WiFi module; rewriting the code from scratch to streamline it and increase reliability; as well as integrate it with Amazon Alexa using the [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) platform. 

This was my first electronics project and gave me valuable experience of wiring - having to consider grounding, voltage requirements, etc. It also gave me a baseline understanding of C++, which I can carry forwards into other projects, should I choose to use it in future.
